# Computer_Graphics_MiniProject
This project is a collision evasion process implemented in the form of a game. Here the
user is allowed to control the movement of the plane through a collision course. The objective is
to escape the obstacles and travel as far as possible. The plane’s upward movement is controlled
by the keyboard key “w” . Holding and pressing the “w” key takes the plane higher and holding
and pressing the “s” key results in the plane descending down. The main obstacle is a block. The
user must make sure no part of the plane touches the block. The score of the plane increases each
time it moves through the block. At any instance the user can restart the game by pressing “r” on
the keyboard. The library glut.h is utilized in the implementation of the game as it provides a wide
range of options to draw the necessary shapes.
